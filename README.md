# Azure-Resource-Helper
 Just an excuse to learn flask framework, and save time at work easily creating the most common Azure resources.

To run this. simply clone the repo and run
	
	cd C:/path/to/clonedRepo
	SET FLASK_APP=mainPage.py
	flask run
	
If an error shows up, you may need to install flask

	pip install flask
	
Hope this helps!
